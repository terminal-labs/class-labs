# Multiple arguments

Up to this point we've only used the cmd.run module with one argument in each salt state. Salt states often include multiple arguments. For this lab I've included one of our original solutions. 

## Assignment

Add two arguments to the current salt state. The first argument will be to specify that the cmd.run module is using the bash language to execute shell commands. The second argument will specify the working directory to execute the bash commands inside.
